# HOW TO RUN

Upload bitstream via JTAG (see note below).

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: This is extremely experimental and may damage your machine and or display (mine are still ok, though).  
After uploading this bitstream, your C64U won't reboot, and you will need to recover it.
To recover you C64U, re-upload the official C64U bitstream via JTAG and then run the updater program to restore its functionalty.

If you don't know what I am talking about, __DO NOT__ run this.
